  # omo-ai's pinned engine @code-yeongyu/senpi bundles a complete node_modules
  # inside its tarball, so the lockfile records its dependencies as `inBundle`
  # entries without registry metadata. `npm install` still resolves some of
  # them from manifests (peer dependencies of the bundled
  # @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk, and the declared-vs-bundled version
  # conflicts for https-proxy-agent/zod), and the offline npm cache only
  # carries packuments for entries with `resolved`. Merge in top-level
  # registry entries for those packages (versions senpi declares) so the
  # prefetcher caches their packuments; npm prunes the packages themselves
  # from the tree again as unneeded.
