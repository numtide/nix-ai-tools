Exploring the integration between Nix and AI coding agents. This repository serves as a testbed for packaging, sandboxing, and enhancing AI-powered development tools within the Nix ecosystem.

## Project Purpose

As Nix and DevOps consultants, this work is part of our strategic explorationâ€”we are evaluating how LLMs and coding agents will transform our consulting practice and the solutions we deliver to clients. Through these experiments, we aim to:

- **Stay ahead of the curve**: Understand how AI agents will reshape infrastructure-as-code and DevOps practices
- **Enhance our consulting toolkit**: Develop AI-augmented workflows that deliver better results for clients faster
- **Build expertise**: Position ourselves as leaders in AI-enhanced Nix and DevOps consulting
- **Create client value**: Discover how AI agents can solve complex infrastructure challenges more effectively
- **Develop best practices**: Establish patterns for secure, reproducible AI integration in enterprise environments

## Integration Patterns

This project explores several key integration patterns between Nix and AI agents:

### 1. Reproducible AI Tool Deployment

- **Declarative packaging**: All AI tools are packaged as Nix derivations, ensuring reproducible builds across different systems
- **Version pinning**: Exact versions are locked via flake.lock for consistent behavior
- **Cross-platform support**: Native support for Linux and macOS on both x86_64 and aarch64

### 2. Security and Sandboxing

- **claudebox**: Demonstrates running AI agents in bubblewrap sandboxes with restricted filesystem access
- **Transparency**: All AI agent actions are logged and displayed in real-time via tmux integration
- **Controlled access**: Read-only system access with write permissions limited to project directories

### 3. Tool Composition and Routing

- **claude-code-router**: Shows how to decouple AI interfaces from specific providers
- **Alternative backends**: Route requests to different LLM providers while maintaining the same interface
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new AI tools through modular package structure

### 4. Development Environment Integration

- **Unified tooling**: AI agents work seamlessly within Nix development shells
- **Format integration**: AI-generated code automatically follows project formatting rules
- **Dependency management**: AI tools have access to all project dependencies through Nix

## Automated Updates

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically update all packages and flake inputs daily. Updates are created as individual pull requests for easy review and testing. See `.github/workflows/update.yml` for the workflow configuration.

## Experimental Features and Future Directions

This repository serves as a laboratory for exploring how Nix can enhance AI-powered development:

### Current Experiments

- **Sandboxed execution**: claudebox demonstrates transparent, sandboxed AI agent execution
- **Provider abstraction**: claude-code-router explores decoupling AI interfaces from specific providers
- **Tool composition**: Investigating how multiple AI agents can work together in Nix environments

### Future Exploration Areas

#### Dynamic Development Environment Integration

- **Automatic devshell reloading**: Enable AI agents to detect and reload their development shells whenever the Nix configuration changes
- **Live environment updates**: Seamless integration of new tools and dependencies without interrupting AI agent sessions
- **State preservation**: Maintain AI agent context across devshell reloads

#### Enhanced Tool Discovery

- **Nixpkgs program indexing**: Make the entire nixpkgs collection queryable by AI agents for dynamic tool discovery
- **Smart tool suggestions**: AI agents can recommend and instantly access appropriate tools from nixpkgs based on task requirements
- **On-demand tool loading**: Just-in-time provisioning of development tools without pre-declaring all dependencies

#### Advanced Workspace Management

- **Git worktree integration**: Enable AI agents to dynamically create and manage git worktrees for parallel development branches
- **Isolated experiment spaces**: Each AI task can operate in its own worktree without affecting the main development flow
- **Automatic context switching**: AI agents can seamlessly move between different worktrees based on task requirements

#### Asynchronous Collaboration

- **Online work sessions**: Support for long-running, asynchronous AI agent sessions that persist beyond terminal sessions
- **Background task execution**: AI agents can continue working on tasks while developers focus on other activities
- **Progress synchronization**: Real-time updates and notifications for ongoing AI agent work
- **Session handoff**: Ability to pause, resume, and transfer AI agent sessions between different environments

#### Additional Research Areas

- **Deterministic AI outputs**: Using Nix's reproducibility features to create more predictable AI behaviors
- **Context management**: Leveraging Nix's declarative nature to manage AI agent contexts and memory
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI tools through Nix expressions
- **Audit trails**: Complete provenance tracking of AI-generated code through Nix derivations

### Research Questions

#### Technical Integration

- How can AI agents dynamically adapt to changing Nix environments without losing context?
- What's the best way to expose the entire nixpkgs ecosystem to AI agents for tool discovery?
- Can git worktrees provide effective isolation for parallel AI agent experiments?
- How do we build robust asynchronous AI workflows that survive disconnections and environment changes?
- What abstractions are needed to make Nix environments truly AI-native?
- How can we balance AI agent autonomy with security and reproducibility guarantees?

#### Consulting Practice Evolution

- How will AI agents transform Nix and DevOps consulting engagements?
- What new service offerings can we create by combining Nix expertise with AI capabilities?
- How do we help clients adopt AI-enhanced DevOps practices safely and effectively?
- Which infrastructure challenges become trivial with AI assistance vs requiring human expertise?
- How can we use AI to accelerate Nix adoption and reduce the learning curve for clients?
- What governance and compliance frameworks are needed for AI-assisted infrastructure management?
